### Homeboy!!

This is an android app that intends to make use of Android phones as home
automation remotes.

They are managed by a configuration server, [Homeboy-Node](https://github.com/scotttherobot/Homeboy-Node),
which you can run. In fact, you need to run it to use this app.

It allows you to define configurations for remotes to be used to hit REST
APIs, like those used for home automation. Stick a few cheap Android
phones around the house on the walls and you're set.

For more info on the project, see my [personal site](http://scottvanderlind.com).
